- Daily high and low temperatures
- Weather conditions with visual icons
- Precipitation probability
- Wind speed predictions

### 5. Airport Details
View detailed information for each airport:
- Full airport name
- Municipality/city
- IATA and ICAO codes
- Precise latitude and longitude coordinates
- Elevation in feet
- Airport type classification

## Data Sources

- **Weather Integration**: Open-Meteo API client

### Data Processing
- Airport data loaded from CSV files on server startup
- In-memory caching for fast access
- Organized hierarchically by continent ‚Üí country ‚Üí airports
- Efficient filtering for medium and large airports only

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following tRPC procedures:

### Airport Endpoints
- `airports.getContinents` - List all continents with airports
- `airports.getCountries` - Get countries for a selected continent
- `airports.getAirports` - Get airports for a continent/country combination
- `airports.getAirportDetails` - Get detailed information for a specific airport
- `airports.search` - Search airports by name, city, or code

### Weather Endpoints
- `weather.getForecast` - Get 7-day weather forecast for coordinates

## Usage Guide

### Browsing Airports

1. **Select a Continent**: Click the "Continent" dropdown and choose from the 7 available continents
2. **Select a Country**: After selecting a continent, the "Country" dropdown will populate with available countries
3. **View Airport List**: Once a country is selected, all airports in that country will be displayed in a scrollable list
4. **Select an Airport**: Click on any airport from the list to view its details

### Using Search

1. Type at least 2 characters in the search box
2. Results will appear instantly below the search field
3. Click on any search result to view that airport's details
4. Search works for airport names, cities, IATA codes, and ICAO codes

### Viewing Weather

When an airport is selected:
1. Current weather displays at the top with temperature, conditions, wind, and humidity
2. 7-day forecast shows below with daily forecasts
3. Each forecast day includes high/low temps, weather icon, precipitation chance, and wind speed

### Using the Map

1. The map automatically centers on the selected region
2. Click the + and - buttons to zoom in and out
3. Drag the map to pan around
4. Click on airport markers to select that airport
5. The map updates automatically when you select different continents or countries

## Weather Icons Guide

The application uses intuitive weather icons:
- ‚òÄÔ∏è Clear sky
- ‚õÖ Partly cloudy
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudy
- üåßÔ∏è Rain
- ‚õàÔ∏è Thunderstorm
- üå®Ô∏è Snow
- üå´Ô∏è Fog

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Airport data is loaded once on server startup and cached in memory
- Initial load includes parsing ~60,000 airports from CSV
- Subsequent requests are served from cache for instant response

### Map Rendering
- Markers are rendered dynamically based on visible airports
- Map tiles are loaded on-demand from OpenStreetMap
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Weather API
- Weather data is fetched on-demand when an airport is selected
- Open-Meteo API provides fast, reliable responses
- No API key required, no rate limiting concerns

## Browser Compatibility

The application is fully compatible with modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Three-column layout with sidebar, map, and details
- **Tablet**: Two-column layout with collapsible sidebar
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with stacked components

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Real-time flight tracking integration
- Airport facilities and services information
- Historical weather data and trends
- User accounts for saving favorite airports
- Push notifications for weather alerts
- Multi-language support
- Dark mode theme option

## Data Accuracy

### Airport Information
Airport data comes from the OurAirports database, which is maintained by aviation enthusiasts and verified by the community. While generally accurate, some information may be outdated or incomplete for smaller airports.

### Weather Forecasts
Weather data is provided by Open-Meteo, which aggregates data from multiple national weather services. Forecasts are updated regularly and are generally accurate for 3-5 days ahead, with decreasing accuracy for longer-range forecasts.

## Privacy & Data Usage

- No user data is collected or stored
- No cookies are used for tracking
- Weather API calls are made server-side to protect user privacy
- Map tiles are loaded from OpenStreetMap servers (subject to their privacy policy)
